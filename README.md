# fuzzy_logic

A rudimentary program implementing a simple fuzzy logic controller. 
The ball wants to avoid incoming obstacles and is controlled by the fuzzy logic module, which
takes in three variables:

- distance from the obstacle,
- distance from the wall,
- current speed

and ouputs new speed (the last variable is therefore a feedback loop).
