# fuzzy_logic

A rudimentary program implementing a simple fuzzy logic controller. 
It controls a ball that wants to avoid incoming obstacles. The controller takes in three variables:

- distance from the obstacle,
- distance from the wall,
- current speed

and ouputs new speed (the last variable is therefore in a feedback loop).
